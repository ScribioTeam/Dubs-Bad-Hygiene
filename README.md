What am i doing!!!!

Hygiene
The most important thing to do after landing is build a latrine, a water tub, and a primitive well or nearby surface water to fill the tub, they will wash with the water tub but this will quickly become dirty and need filling with fresh water from the primitive well or surface water, after that everything is optional and just makes it easier for pawns to keep clean and happy.

Water
For plumbed running water you will need a piped well (NOT Primitive), water pump, and storage tower. Build wells over the indicated ground water areas, build either an electric pump or wind pump to pump the water, and a water tower to store the water, the pumps have a capacity and so do the wells so try and match them up.

Hot Water
Colonists like to have hot baths and showers and don't like cold water, so you must build a hot water tank to store hot water, and 1 of the 3 boilers or a solar heater to heat the water, the tank uses heating capacity just like a radiator. You can control gas and electric boilers by turning on thermostat mode on the hot water tank, it will switch boilers on for 1 hour when the temp gets low saving you money on your energy bills!. An early game low tech option is to place a campfire next to a bath to heat it.

Heating
A central heating system is available if you choose to use it, simply connect radiators to your plumbing net and they will use up heating capacity from your boilers, you can add as many radiators and boilers as you need, electric boilers have a power setting, the log and gas boilers are the same as an electric on max power. You can place radiators in every room and be sure that temperatures will be cosy. You can control electric and gas boilers with a room thermostat, which is similar to the thermostat mode on the hot water tank, if you drop the default temp to 20c your boiler should only do very short pulses in a mild winter as radiators stay warm after a boiler is switched off.

Air conditioning
A multi-split air conditioning system is available, similar in function to the central heating, you have an outdoor unit which you place...outdoors, this provides cooling capacity and has a power setting. Then pipe it to indoor units which you place.... indoors, they are used for general room cooling, or pipe to freezer units which can be placed inside of, or as walls for....  freezers. The outdoor units do lose efficiency in hot weather.

Privacy
Privacy is important to colonists, they dont like using the toilet in front of each other, make sure toilets and showers/baths are private or in small stalls or around corners out of line of sight. And avoid making centralized public toilets, its better to spread small washrooms around your base especially next to work areas like a kitchen or workshop.
Colonists and visitors shouldn't wander into occupied toilets or try to use a shower while someones on the toilet.
Couples won't mind seeing each other, prisoners also don't care since they have low expectations.
You can have same sex showers like a typical locker room using the gender restrictions.
You can make private en suite bathrooms, link the room to a bed by using the link button on any fixture, they can be shared by couples.
Pawns will search only a small radius for toilets when they are outside of the home area to prevent them making long trips to the bathroom, so make sure a toilet or latrine is nearby if you are off mining on the other side of the map.

Irrigation
If you have an abundance of water then you can make use of the irrigation sprinklers, these will turn on at 5am every morning for exactly 1 hour, providing a boost to fertility which slowly wears off over the day as the water evaporates. They will use thousands of litres of water so make sure you have enough supply or isolate the tank from your normal plumbing system so people dont run out of water to flush the toilets. Fire sprinklers are also available, they react to room temperature or nearby fire and can be manually triggered. Irrigation should stack with any modded terrain types, use the mod options to adjust the strength.

Fertilizer
You can produce fertilizer from sewage, which when placed on growable terrain, will provide a fertility boost for just under a year, collect sewage from septic tanks by setting the percentage threshold for when it should be emptied by a hauler, or by using the remove sewage designator to extract areas of sewage on the surface that has been released by sewage outlets. Like irrigation it should stack with any modded terrain types, use the mod options to adjust the strength to your liking.

Misc
There are several extra items which can either be cosmetic items, or have a function if certain mod options are turned on, kitchen sinks offer a cleanliness boost to a room, litter boxes will be used by cats if pet bladder is turned on. Washing machines can be stared at for hours by bored colonists.

Mod Options
There are many settings in the mod options menu, such as hygiene and bladder rates, capacities, and a few experimental features which may or may not work. Needs can be enabled for specific types of pawn or active hediff.
